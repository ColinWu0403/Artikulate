However, I have some personal boundaries that I've been trying to enforce for my mental well-being. Here's the deal: these family gatherings have always been chaotic, with lots of drama and unsolicited advice. Last time, it took me weeks to recover from the stress. So, this time around, I decided to prioritize my mental health and declined the invitation. Now, my family is upset with me, saying I'm being selfish and ruining the tradition. I understand the importance of family, but AITA for prioritizing my mental health and setting boundaries? I've tried explaining my reasons, but they don't seem to understand.I feel guilty for causing tension within the family, but I also believe it's essential to prioritize self-care. What do you think, Reddit? AITA for choosing my mental health over a family gathering, or should I have just sucked it up for the sake of tradition?"
