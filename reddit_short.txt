1,"[AITA] Threw my parent's donuts away My parents are diabetic, morbidly obese, and addicted to food. I'm the same, minus the diabetes. I've been trying for a while to eat healthily and lose weight. So have they, but yet every time they go to the store, they bring home junk food. I understand that it's hard for them, but it's also hard to stay on track with my healthier lifestyle when there's junk food all around me. Plus, they're getting older, so it is crucial for them to get healthy now. A few weeks ago, they brought home 4 bags of donuts, and I emptied each pack into the trash. Am I an asshole for this? **Edit:** I love all the responses. Got one ""no"", one ""maybe"", and one ""yes"". I agree with all of you. **"
5,"AITA Had a disagreement about Les Miserables with a coworker. I love the musical *Les Miserables*. A coworker of mine said that they didn't like it. I asked why and they said, among other things, that ""it's not a musical, it's an opera."" Now, I happen to be an opera singer. I told them adamantly that it is NOT an opera. There are a number of things that make this true, but if you can take my word for it- and I hope you can- it's not a matter of opinion whether a mainstream musical is an opera or not. It is a musical, period. My coworker thought otherwise. ""My boyfriend writes musicals and he agrees with me"" was the extent of her argument. Well, he may well write musicals but that doesn't mean he knows anything about opera. You might as well ask a jazz pianist to tell you about Beethoven- it's not the same area of expertise even if it's related. I told her ""You're entitled to your opinion even if it's wrong"" in a sort-of joking way. Maybe I was being dickish. I gotta know- am I the asshole?"
6,"[ATIA] I permanently give a customer decaf. His name is Scoop. Over the two years I have worked for this coffee shop, he has told us our store or another store has made his drink wrong, or he spilled it, returning to us an empty cup, or nothing at all. He then asks to have another one. He is sixty. He flirts with all the young (20-30s) women who wait in line. He had a one minute conversation with my mother once in line and now asks me every time, ""How is the family?"" as if he knows me. He chats up all of the wealthy businessmen who come in. I permanently give him decaf. Am I the asshole?"
7,"[AITA] My roommate has many undesirable qualities, but I may be talking about him too much. I'm a college student. My first roommate dropped out in October, and I got a new one to start he 2nd semester. He's the worst. Here's some of the undesirable qualities about him. * Incredible snoring. I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven't approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was ""have you told him about your snoring??"" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It's too loud not to know. This is fine, you can't help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I'm not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point... * He's a lazy fuck. He's very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it's because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn't do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn't help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality.. * He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn't stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a ""stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3"". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn't even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it. Tonight though, I thought about something. I am talking"
8,"[AITA] Hockey Fan I went to a hockey game at my college and since I didn't have season tickets to sit in the student section, got the nosebleed seats around center ice about 6 rows from the top. It was against our rivals, so the seats were packed. Every time the action came around the boards on our side, I had to stand up to see what was happening. I also stood when we got close to scoring a goal. The people behind me were pissed that I kept standing up and told me to just watch what was happening on the jumbotron. My thoughts were that if I wanted to sit down and watch the game on a screen, I would have stayed at home and watched from my couch. What are your thoughts; am I the asshole?"
9,"[AITA] Door to door sales person Door to door sales person came to my door around 9:15pm trying to peddle some attic insulation and asking if I've received my rebate. I interrupted him mid sentence by saying ""I'm putting my kids to bed and I'm not interested"" (which I truly was doing) he tried to counter but I was already shutting the door in his face . Am I the asshole for not hearing him out?"
10,"[AITA] Gave my friend some peanuts, asked for some later. I was in France this summer with two of my friends and I was eating some peanuts on the train into the city. I was full so I gave the rest to one of my friends and said he could keep them. A few hours later we were at the fountain that's outside the Louvre and the Arc that isn't the Arc de Triumf, it's like the red granite looking one with like a gold chariot on it. Anyway I was like hey can I have some of those peanuts, and my ""friend"" was like ""No way dude you gave those to me."" I didn't have any other food so I was like wtf, can I have like one of your protein bars or something and he was like no, I was like are you fucking kidding me and grabbed his backpack as collateral for a handful of peanuts, and he was like fine take your fucking peanuts AND THREW THEM IN THE FOUNTAIN. I gave his backback back so that I wouldn't make more of a scene. His excuse was that he carried this bag of peanuts which weighed maybe 5 ounces. He is adamant that he was in the right and I was out of line, so did the other friend I was with, I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone, so tell me am I the asshole?"
11,"[AITA] Missing my Cousin-in-Law's Wedding to Be With my Mom During her Chemo I don't get along with my in-laws very well. A lot of it comes down to us being from different cultures, but most of my well-intended mistakes have been interpreted as offensive. I do get along with my aunt & uncle-in-law and they've attempted to stick up for me to my in-laws. My cousin-in-law is getting married in a few weeks. I get along with her but I'm not close to her. I've been dreading the wedding because interactions with my in-laws are always very stressful. A month ago, my mom was diagnosed with extremely aggressive breast cancer. She's stage 4 with type 4 lymphoma. While the doctors have a lot of optimism, there's a very real chance it could be fatal. The doctors are rushing her into treatment before the cancer metastasizes. Her second chemo treatment, the ""bad one"" as the doctors call it, is the same day as my cousin-in-law's wedding. My mom lives 400 miles away; my cousin-in-law is local. My mom is terrified of the chemo. I planned on being there for all her chemo treatments since I telecommute and my boss has told me to be wherever I need to be in order to take care of my mom. Last night, my wife asked me what suit I plan on wearing to her cousin's wedding. I told her I'm not going because the wedding is the same weekend as one of my mom's chemo treatments and I need to be there for my mom. My wife told me she didn't use an excuse out of my cousin's wedding. [AITA] #1: I angrily replied my wife was being unfair because no one in her family was dying of cancer when my cousin was getting married. [AITA] #2: My wife replied my mom isn't dying, just very ill, so it would be selfish of me to take care of her. I told my wife she was being an asshole and walked away. I'm struggling with the ethics on this one. I believe taking care of sick family always comes first no matter whose side of the family is sick. Is that a wrong thing to believe?"
13,"Argument with a friend via text message (may be long) I'm likely going to get some flak for arguing with someone over the phone, but the fact that I couldn't speak with her face-to-face was actually the reason this whole thing happened in the first place. This former friend of mine often met with me for lunch or coffee or whatever every so often, and we'd make a day of it, as we lived in towns roughly 100 miles apart. To do this, we typically arranged something via text message, which worked totally fine. Anyway, the last time I saw her was in November, and admittedly she was, at the time anyway, busy with a number of commitments and problems that had come up. However, I have my own commitments including a job and voluntary events, and she was totally aware of this, as well as being aware that I was also similarly going through a number of issues of my own. It cannot have been an issue of time as she had more free time than I do and a lot more money than me too, despite being on welfare benefits and getting things like a house (something I would so desperately love) pretty much given to her. Then she meets me and whines about how terrible the house is or how she's bored sitting in the house all day, knowing fine and well I've got to work for the little money I earn. Anyway, we agreed in November that we'd try and meet in December, just before Christmas. When this didn't happen, I hoped that we could at least have a coffee before the New Year came round and I would be busy at work. In both cases it was always some excuse or another, and eventually New Year came without me hearing a single word from her. So come the middle of January I rang her and asked her what was happening. She promised me **faithfully** that in two weeks time (the start of Febuary) she'd meet me. This, like the other previous times, she told me she couldn't meet me and it would be two weeks before she could meet me. I told her that she should ring me in a week and let me know what was happening, as I'd had some holidays booked from work and so was freer than usual to meet. I made a point of waiting until last week to give her some space, but when the usual promise of meeting in two week's time got trotted out, I gave her an ultimatum via text. I'll bulletpoint the texts in paraphrased fashion: * **Text 1**: Look, all I'm asking for is a date. I've got my work and I'm also bored of getting messed around, bearing in mind I'm being promised you'll meet me. *Her response: Yeah well I've got problems in my life and all I'm trying to do is be a good friend, and you're making demands of me and being horrible to me.* **Text 2**: Well yeah, I've got problems"
14,"[AITA] Staying at my parents house I'm a twenty year old student who has lived away from home for the past three and a half years. I'm taking a semester off and spending a month and a half of it at my parents house. This is the longest time that I have spent at their house in the past three and a half years for a slew of reasons. I usually only come home for a few days around holidays and then ship off back to school. I did not want to spend this much time at home, my parents basically bribed me back by paying my rent and bills for the month of February and March. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or unappreciative, I really appreciate their help, but I have been completely financially independent for the past three years and that is the way that I like it. I don't mind providing for myself and being responsible for myself financially, I actually prefer it because I don't feel obligated to other people. However, my parents were extremely adamant about me spending some time at home over my break. They don't fully understand my reasonings for taking this semester off and think that it's because I am unstable or something, which is untrue I simply needed a break like many students. Anyways, I've been here and been absolutely miserable. I hate the job that I'm working here and absolutely prefer the one at school. I don't have many friends here so I've been incredibly bored. Lastly, I have been fighting nonstop with my parents and just don't get along with my dad at all. Every conversation we have blows up into an unproportional argument involving tons of shit from the past and I end up saying really terrible things and feeling like a piece of shit. I try to avoid anything other than meaningless remarks about the t.v. show we're watching or how food tastes so this doesn't happen because I feel terrible constantly arguing with him when I'm in his home and he's paying for all of my stuff. But he keeps prying at things and me until I ultimately end up saying things that I really regret and feeling like an ungrateful piece of shit. Am I the asshole for just not wanting to come home at all because I knew that this is what it would be like or should I just suck everything up because they're paying for my shit?"
15,"Was ItA? This takes place a year ago. Me and a friend of 8 years stopped being friends over this. It pisses me off every time I remember it. Okay; so I'm going to start with the fact that I am a relatively young redditor (15) and this took place a year ago. We were sitting during lunch and this chick we use to hang out would usually give him her leftovers. So this day I asked her prior if I could have her leftovers, and she said ok. When I reminded her he was like ""dude what the fuck I asked her first"" and I told him how I asked prior and she gave me the leftovers. He flipped out and did this huge rant on how I'm a ""huge liar"" and how I lie so much (which wasn't true by the way, I pretty much only lied like a little kid normally would in 2nd grade.) and I think it was only to make me look bad; he left and moved as far away as possible. We haven't talked since. I don't know his side and I probably never will, but my speculation was that he may have liked the girl or something."
16,"Ok, I weighed in on some of you, so I suppose I should share my own AITA. This is kind of long, so bear with me. A couple years ago my 19-year-old son got a new gf. After I met her, I told my son (let's call him Tyler) that I thought Katie* was really sweet and smart and looked like she liked to eat. Ok, I know that sounds bad, but Tyler's previous gf Dakota was borderline and refused to eat in front of anyone, and it always bothered me. I mean, if Tyler invites you over for a holiday meal, at least sit at the table and play with your food. I guarantee no one would notice, but they will notice you sitting on the couch sulking. But I digress, and I had to, to make the rest make sense. About a year later, Tyler and Katie were hanging out here and he tells her what I said. She looked kind of upset, and I know she thought I was making a comment about her weight, but I swear I wasn't. I explained the whole Dakota situation, which she should've understood because she knew her and hated her with a passion. I apologized, and explained what I meant. I thought we were good. Cut to **three** months later. I'm at work and get a text from Katie's mom: ""You're a fucking bully! How dare you talk to an 18-year-old child like that. You told my daughter she was a fat pig!"" What? She texts back: ""You're a sad pathetic cunt picking on a child."" This goes on and on. I mean, I thought we were friends. This literally came out of fucking nowhere! I tried to explain that I love to cook, and I love when people come over and they like to eat. I really don't give a shit that the girl weighed 200 pounds. Whatever. My son loved her, so I loved her. So am I an asshole for saying a girl looks like she likes to eat?"
17,"Roommate is annoying the shit out of me and I confronted him about it. OK. I'm the type of person that enjoys a quiet environment. I could stand some noise here and there, people talking around me, etc. But I cannot stand sharp noises like knocking on wood out coughing. I can tolerate it for a few minutes but when it's a constant thing throughout the day I it asks me so much. My roommate does these type of noises constantly. He bands his fingers against a wooden bed frame all day. And he coughs every 10 minutes which makes me want to pull my hair out. It is a dry cough but he choughs with his mouth completely open without covering his mouth or trying to make it less noisy. I tried using earplugs and sound proof earphones and I could still hear it. I guess he caught a slight cold in these past couple of weeks because I like to leave the window open because it makes me sleep better but there window is closer to him so he felt more colder. So I agreed to close it since he is sick with the condition that he tries t keep the finger banging (hehe) down and tries to make his coughs less apparent to me. He just told me that I'm just a jerk who complains to much. Is it too much to ask for though? Am I asshole for asking a sick roommate to keep down his coughing?"
19,"Am I an asshole for not wanting to be friends with my coworker?? work with a girl name Meg, she's really sweet and everything but she definitely has some problems. Meg has a physical disability and I think that she might have some learning disabilities and lacks social skills. Over the last couple of years she has latched herself onto me and I have to constantly listen to all of her problems no matter how big or small they are. Our conversations are very one-sided with her just running her mouth constantly about how she hates her job, coworkers, family, and the list goes on. Whenever I try to chime in with my problems she turns the conversation back to herself, I can tell she's at least trying to be empathetic but it doesn't really work. Here is an example: I had a blood vessel rupture in my retina and she tells me that sometimes the scab on her leg bleeds(yeah, because that's fucking similar!!!!!). She knows what a retina is by the way, she just has to constantly talk about herself.I dont know if she's nacrissist or just super lonely. I feel bad that shes lonely but at the same time, i REALLY dont want to be her friend. Im so tired of her and when i know that i will be working with her for the day i always feel like shit. I'm usually a laid back and somewhat happy person but when I talk to Meg I feel stressed out and drained afterwords from just listening to her and my guilt of wanting her get the fuck away from me. Am I an asshole for not wanting to befriend a miserable lonely coworker??What about the fact that she has a really bad handicap??"
20,"Standing up at a John Mayer concert Hi /r/AmITheAsshole! I just heard this community exists and I thought it would be the perfect place to talk about this. I posted the whole story in /r/pettyrevenge and got a really mixed bag of responses, so I'm curious what people here think. Basically, I was at a John Mayer concert, in a pretty good seat but off to the side (not in the pit, which is relevant). When JM came out, he was playing a really rockin' tune, so I stood up and started jamming out. I would say ~90% of the people in the arena were standing for this, but my section was a disproportionately sitting one. I was really the only one in the immediate area standing. I would stand and sit intermittently as the songs went on based on the dance-factor of the song and how much I liked it. At one point while I was standing up, two women about four rows behind me started throwing popcorn at me and yelling at me to sit down. I got really embarrassed and sat, but after a few minutes I was upset with how they had handled it, so a few songs later, I stood back up (with the help of my girlfriend and a few other people around us who had scene the exchange). By this point a few other isolated people/couples had done the same for a couple songs at a time. My ""petty revenge"" was subtly encouraging people around me to stand up, helping create a majority so that a.) it would be fine for me to stand and b.) the women would have a harder time telling 20 people to sit down. To be fair, I was a lot meaner in the telling in /r/pettyrevenge, so [here is the link] if you'd like to read it and the ensuing comments. I just kind of assumed people would be on my side, as you can tell by my whiny edit at the top. Am I the asshole? I want to believe I'm not, mostly because I think throwing popcorn at someone is incredibly rude, at which point I didn't care, and I would have responded much more sympathetically to a more gentle approach. Other people felt that I was not entitled to any courtesies because I started the asshole train by standing in the first place, and honestly I understand that too, which is why I sat down in the first place. I didn't want to be rude and block views. But I also believed that I wasn't in the wrong to stand given the nature of the act--he's got some jams and is very encouraging of light dancing. Still, for people that just wanted to sit down and enjoy the show, I was definitely hurting the experience. Please let me know what you think. **tl;dr** Stood up at a concert, got popcorn'd, stood back up later, encouraging others to do the same."
21,"AITA for complaining about my co-worker? I'll try to keep it short... I work in a restaurant, I am a waitress and my co-worker is a door host (i.e. greets customers, takes them to tables and so on). So on Saturday night, place is really busy, I have a million things to do, just the usual. Co-worker sits a table of four and spends about ten minutes standing there talking to them. Door hosts usually just give them menus, tell them info about the place and hand them off to me. He finally stops chatting and waves me over and says they want to order. For the rest of the time they are there he is CONSTANTLY coming over to them, for a good 10 minutes at a time, leaving the other door host, who has worked there for 2 days, by herself on the door. They want to order more drinks and instead of telling me, which is standard procedure, he goes off to the bar and gets them himself. I ended up having to ask them what they had so I can add it to the bill which I find really unprofessional. They ask for the bill, I drop it and go to the back to get a drink for someone, and I come back to find him taking the payment. Now door hosts are not floor or till trained, they are in no way allowed to use the micros, put in orders or take payments. However I'm not going to go charging up in front of guests and grab the card machine from him so I let it happen. I then find out at the end of the night he was boasting to other members of staff that my table gave him a £10 tip and he's keeping it. So I put in a complaint to management, the next day they have an investigation meeting, I was on the floor at the time and during the course of the meeting he is crying and getting really upset. And now I feel bad. AITA? TL:DR Untrained door host steals my table and my tip, is generally unprofessional, I get angry and complain. He cries."
22,"AItA for having feelings and sleeping with my close friend whose in a relationship? Met this guy at a social gathering and became close friends with him quickly. We talk everyday and hang out a on average 2-3 times a week. We started hugging more often, then cuddling during movies/t.v at my place and one night after one too many beers we start making out and have sex twice that night, he ends up sleeping in my bed and the next morning I discuss it with him. We both decided it would be best if it didn't happen again, that neither of us regret the action and that we shouldn't tell his boyfriend about it. That we should try to go back to how things were. That works for a little while until one evening we end up sleeping together again. This time we talk a little more in depth about it, I tell him I like him a lot and he tells me that he thinks I'm cute and funny but that he's confused about his feelings toward me and that he's not the best at figuring his feelings out. He did say he knows that he's not ready to give up on his relationship yet and that it wouldn't be fair to me or him if I waited around for him. Despite being hurt by his words, he was very gentle about it and stressed that he would hate it if this ruined our friendship. So now we're back to being friends, we still talk pretty frequently and hang out every week. Basically, everything is nearly identical to how things were prior to having sex. The only issue is that I still have these feelings and I'm trying to get over them. I don't want to change anything between us because I think that would hurt too much. **tl;dr My personal life has become a Taylor Swift song and it sucks** *Side Note: He confided in me after a month of being friends about his relationship problems and I learned that the boyfriend has a history of mental ailments (the BF claims to have Dissociative Identity Disorder) and neglected him for 7 months and cheated on him (my friend saw messages from other guys that are very incriminating). Point is, there's clearly a lot of latent animosity and it's all become unhealthy but he's trying to still ""make it work.""*"

My ex had a crush on him and I had to deal with it, but he knew we were together. A lot of people think he is attractive and my current gf just posted on his wall that she ""missed him and to come back into his life"". I know that's just how she talks and she doesn't mean anything by it, but it fucking hurts. She does not know the story, but I might tell her... I am not a controlling person nor would I ever attempt to limit her in any way. But she needs to understand how that status made me feel given the context; I hardly see her (once a week alone time for the past 2 weeks), she don't show me a lot of affection in public (hugs, sometimes kisses but not like I expect), so I am generally frustrated. How do she think her seeing this kid, given our history, makes me feel? So would I be an asshole for telling her about him and me and being upset at her comment?"

Deets: She and I have been dating for a little over 8 months now. We are of completely opposite personalities, yet we have the most beautiful connection; something that I've never felt before. Recently we had to get rid of some lawn furniture that we didn't need and after a Craig'sList post her ex-boyfriend responded and accepted the furniture. Mind you, we are very open and honest with each other in our relationship, but recent conversations have me miffed --> She wants to invite her ex-boyfriend over for dinner because she ""misses the friendship"" that they had. I'm pretty sure they had a lunch date together today, without her telling me about it. Am I The Asshole for confronting her about my intuition and gut feelings, or am I the asshole for her going on a platonic ""lunch date"" with her ex-boyfriend?"

28,"AITA for selling an unreliable product? Hi everyone, a while ago I bought a water filter that is used for hiking or other outdoor activities. Its purpose is to make dirty or contaminated water drinkable. The filter I bought was from a very well respected manufacturer (Katadyn if anyone is interested) but this specific model had some major design flaws. I sent in my filter because it had failed after a short time and got a brand new unit in return. Because I didn't really trust this filter anymore, I got one from a different brand and sold the exchanged one on a small trekking forum. That was years ago and I kind of forgot all about it. Until I stumbled upon a travel report where someone has trouble with his water filter and eventually he and his friend become sick and have to cancel their trip. He wrote that he bought the filter on the forums, so I checked and it was in fact the filter that I had sold to him... So now I feel like an asshole because I knew the filter was shit and I still sold it. On the other hand, it was a brand new unit from a respected manufacturer that is still sold at most commercial outdoor stores. Am I the asshole here?"
29,"AITA for not being appreciative enough of the help I was given? Recently I spent a good amount of time traveling around New Zealand. I had a tiny budget, so I was getting around by hitch hiking and sleeping in my tent most nights. One afternoon I was picked up by a friendly older Kiwi. It turned out his business is consulting for struggling hostels, so he very frequently meets travelers like me and picks up hitch hikers. He has traveled the country dozens of times. On the way to my destination he went out of his way to take me to some cool thermal pools and pretty sights. It was great, because I likely would have just passed straight by them if anybody else had picked me up. He was going on a speaking tour over the next week. Shortly before arriving at my destination he said, ""It's too bad your not going to this other way with me next instead. I could show you this spot and that. And I could get you free accomodation in these towns."" Since he had been so friendly, and because I wanted to be open to fun new experiences and people, I decided spur of the moment to change my plan and keep traveling with him instead. I stay in his hotel room with him that night. He got us both dinner with the food budget he had from his employer. He then suggested we buy some alcohol, and asks if I don't mind paying since he got dinner. I had planned on giving up drinking at this point in my trip to save money, but I was happy to since he was being so nice and helpful to me. I bought a couple bottles of wine that got polished off pretty fast. And he ended up sharing a lot of whiskey that he had brought, so he was definitely giving back more than he was asking. We probably stayed up till 2 in the morning drinking, and had some great conversation. The next day we move on to the next city, and basically repeat the night before. I buy a couple bottles of wine, and he very insistently makes me take a couple whiskey shots. At this point his personality is really starting to grate on me, but I figure it would be rude to leave early when he is expecting me to keep traveling with him for a couple more days. Day 3, while we're driving he straight up calls me out for not being appreciative enough of him. In particular, he said that I should be making more of an effort to buy food or drinks. He was mad at me that he had to ask me to buy the wine, and that I wasn't pushing to do so myself.

30,"AITA? A conversation on the recent incident where ""a 9 year old was banned from wearing an MLP backpack because it triggers bullies"" turned ugly. So this happened on reddit itself, and I'm not sure of the policy of posting reddit links, but I'll take a shot at it anyway. Basically what happened was that the commenters were discussing this occurrence, and somewhere below I saw a comment which said, >I know that ultimately, the poor kid shouldn't be bullied over his backpack, but you ever see that episode of King of the Hill where Hank refuses to let Bobby become a husky boy model and pulls him out of a fashion show at the mall just in time to avoid having a nearby group of teenagers pelt the models with donuts? Then Bobby has a revelation and realizes how spot on Hank is and thanks him? I feel like that's what's missing here- a Dad who just puts his foot down and tells him ""No, I'm sorry, but you're not taking that to school. You can hate me now, but trust me, you'll thank me for this later."" I personally disagreed with some aspects of the comment, so I thought to write a reply with my opinion on it. Granted, at this point, I had no negativity toward the commenter at all, and in fact was looking for a conversation: >That's a backward logic that should have no place in school. A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants; if you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such. Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school. Looking back, I can see how it may have came across as rude or ""attacky"". In any case, he responded back: >>That's a backward logic that should have no place in school. >When have public schools ever anything operate on anything but backwards logic? >>A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants >Yes, the my little pony backpack is total analogous to women not being allowed to wear pants.*Totally.* >>f you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? >You should probably tell me I'd tell blacks to get to the back of the bus too, drama queen. >>It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such. >Letting your son wear a My Little Pony backpack to school? Yes, I totally agree. >>Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school. >Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine. I realized at this point that I may have come across as overbearing, so replied trying to clear it up: >>>That's a backward logic that should have no place in school. >>When have public schools ever anything operate on anything but backwards logic?"
31,"[AITA] Just barely avoided a fender-bender in my neighborhood, the other driver follows me to my destination So, I live in a college neighborhood. I was just leaving my apartment to go to the grocery store, and I get to a ""T"" in the road. The other car, a pretty new-looking silver Audi, is driving down the straight part. I'll admit I wasn't 100% attentive at this moment, but I also think the Audi was going a bit too fast for being in a parking lot. There was no stop sign where I was, it was a situation where I was supposed to yield. I judged that the car was far enough away that I had time to make the turn, so I did. The Audi got really close to my car while I turned and had to stop. I knew I fucked up--I was pretty embarrassed so I didn't look to see the driver's face, but I could tell out of the corner of my eye that he wasn't happy. I thought ""Oh well, at least it's over. What's the worst that could happen, he follows me?"" (Which I never thought would actually happen. When this happened, he was driving in the opposite direction from where I was headed. This means he actually made an effort to stop and turn around.) Fast forward about five minutes. I parked at the grocery store. I was grabbing my stuff to get out of the car, and I heard a knock on the window. I was about to get out anyway, so I opened the door. It was someone I didn't recognize. He starts to say, ""Next time, learn how to drive!"" I immediately realized who it was, and I said, ""You followed me here...?!"" ""Yeah, you almost did some serious damage to my car. I live at--I actually work at [apartment complex], and I just don't wanna see people around there driving like that."" ""I'm really sorry...what do you want me to say? Nothing happened. I'll admit I wasn't paying full attention. I'm really sorry. I don't know what else to say."" At this point, I was really freaked out. I figured if this guy followed me, he was at least a little crazy...but after that he pretty much accepted my apology and went on his way. I feel like I should mention that while he got out of his car to talk to me, he left his car parked in the middle of the parking lot. The incident had me pretty shook up for the rest of the day. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and it's people like this who are the reason why I don't like to leave my apartment often. I told my roomies about it later, and we wondered, how far would he have followed me? What if I was driving to the other side of town? This happened a couple days ago, and I've been terrified of running into him again ever since. In my opinion, if you're so worried about your fancy car being damaged, don't bring"
32,"[AItA] Well this was a surprise. So I've been friends with a certain woman who I've had intense non-reciprocal feelings for. I've known her for roughly nine months, and we became pretty close. Just within the last week or so, her hold on my psyche has been broken, and I'm speaking more freely around her now that I'm not quite so worried about what she thinks about me. It seems like all she talks about is her exes (plural) lately. It makes me extremely uncomfortable, but up until now I didn't want to say anything. The other day we're having coffee, and it's a friendly conversation, but she starts spiraling around the same topic (her difficulties telling whether she's attracted to men as opposed to women). I tell her that she's really driving this topic into the ground, and that she's been saying the same thing over and over for ten minutes. She says that she doesn't act like an asshole when I do it (I didn't realize that I did, and I'm not sure if I do). I immediately apologize for my insensitive comment. We sit in silence for a moment, and she leaves as I sit in stunned silence asking myself what had just happened. It turned a complete 180 from friendly to hostile in a split second. I realize that this was probably something important to her to talk about, but I don't think I realized the degree to which it was. I definitely could have said something in a more delicate way or just suffered through the awkwardness inside myself (which I have done on more occasions than I can count for her), but I don't think that her tantrum was an appropriate response either."
33,"[AITA] A dispute at Cold Stone Tonight I went to Cold Stone to get a smoothie. I had $6 on me, which I knew would cover me since a smoothie is $5.59 plus tax ($5.92 total). I order my smoothie and go to the register, where the cashier tries to charge me $6.56 ($6.19 plus tax). The $5.59 plus tax price is posted on their wall, and the higher price is nowhere to be found in the store. I ask why I'm being charged so much, and they say that the price is now higher. I ask them to show me where this higher price is, and the cashier goes to the back. She comes back and says she'll give me a discount, which comes to $6.03. I hold out my $6 and tell her it's the best I can do, which is apparently good enough. I walk out with my smoothie. Am I the asshole? This higher price may have been their legitimate price, but is it reasonable to refuse to pay it if it isn't posted anywhere in the store and a lower price is posted prominently on the menu board?"
34,"AItA: The title, registration, and insurance are in my name Annie and Bonnie are parent and adult child, respectively. Bonnie and I have been, as the story starts out, romantically involved for less than 5 months. I have the ability and tools to do certain jobs that Annie and Bonnie need done. Annie wants to compensate me (which I tried to dissuade her from doing, but she insisted) but Annie doesn't have the cash she thinks the work is worth. Instead, at Bonnie’s suggestion, Annie offers to trade a vehicle worth roughly what the jobs are worth. This vehicle used to belong to her deceased son (Bonnie’s brother). It had also at that time sat idle for nearly 4 years. Because I like the vehicle and have the ability to bring it back to operating order, plus want to keep Annie happy, I accept the offer. Afterward, Annie tells me that she preferred that the vehicle not go to Bonnie after I suggested that she drive it when she wanted (Annie said she was concerned about safety, as it’s a bit top-heavy, not a hardtop, and has nothing but a basic seatbelt). I then find that Bonnie has been really wanting the vehicle anyway, even though she knew of her mother’s objections. At this point I begin to suspect that Bonnie’s running a scheme to get the vehicle despite her mother’s wishes, but since it’s just a suspicion and otherwise we’re having a great relationship, I let it go. I complete just about everything that Bonnie needed, plus some other things that come up incidentally. In the meantime, I’ve spent a good bit of money and time getting the vehicle back into operating order and making a few improvements. The jobs I need to do for Annie require that one or both of them be present or allow me access to out-of-town property. I complete a couple of days’ worth and then something weird happens. Every opportunity that I have to work for Annie, Bonnie has convinced her to take a daytrip, or some other distraction, or gives me conflicting information regarding the arrangements that keeps me from being able to complete the work. Bonnie goes quiet when I ask about this phenomenon, and our relationship falters. Despite what I feel are one-sided efforts on my part to discuss these and other issues, our relationship starts to cool at the 10-11 month mark. I make the split, finally and at the time amicably, after 14 months, with Bonnie bemoaning our “lack of communication” and telling me that only she knows what her mother REALLY wants/needs, and states that my understanding of Annie’s clear language is severely flawed. Due to this and other factors, some of the jobs that Annie needed done did not get done. I don’t feel comfortable contacting Annie directly and risking coming between her and her daughter (they’re basically the only family each of them have left in the local area). A couple of months after we split, Bonnie contacts me on Facebook, requesting that I give the vehicle"
35,"AITA for resenting my cousin's new job? Some background first which is relevant. I've always been considered the most academic of the family and so things like good grades and school performance reports weren't a negotiation, I was expected to work hard and get them. Even when I did, I was rarely given praise for it, other than a short 'well done' or 'good'. Basically I was expected to be a 'good little girl' and just do what I was told. Then there's my cousin. He basically never tried at school and left at 16 with close to nothing to show for it. He was also, and still is to some extent, allowed to do as he pleased. He just seemed content to sit on his bum, collect his unemployment money and just generally laze his life away. Any attempt to speak with him about going to college and getting some qualifications (I wasn't the one speaking to him to clarify.) or about applying for work was met with 'dunno' or 'I'm looking at a course' or 'I'm speaking to a mate' or some other lazy excuse. So skip forward to two weeks ago and a family member mentions that she's heard from someone she knows that there is this job going which my cousin should be 'perfect' to do. Stuff happens, calls get made and abraadabra, my cousin gets the job, no effort required on his part. Now part of the problem I have with the whole thing is that the same help wasn't exactly forthcoming when it came to my own jobsearching, and if anything I was made to feel quite a shitty, horrible failure of a human being by my family for it. There were times when things devolved into screaming matches (not instigated by myself for the most part) because of it. Rather it was the situation that it was down to my effort, despite my family, to find jobs, to post CVs to companies, to secure interviews and then to finally secure the job I now have. All of it was because I put in real effort and actually did something. Another part of me also feels resentment because I know that my cousin isn't the person my family thinks he is. They think he's this wonderful innocent kid, and that he's somehow on a pedestal because he'll do a few odd jobs for them now and again. Yet I've seen the other side of him for myself and I know he's just playing the goodie two-shoes act so he'll get the praise (and money/favours) from them. So, am I being an asshole or not here?"

Here's the OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/21alb5/guy_didnt_get_his_car_key_because_he_was_rude_to/ I thought the guy in question was definitely rude, but that OP's response was a little overboard, as well. Car keys are pretty important; if I were working at guest services and I was pretty sure we had the guy's key, it goes beyond petty revenge to answer him in a way that implies I don't. Doesn't look like many people agreed with me, as I'm currently sitting at -12 - [Link] - and the first comment reply calling me an asshole is at +10. I just thought this situation was a little weird because I've never even made a comment in the negatives before, and I really don't see how I'm wrong. Obviously the guy who lost his key was really rude and shouldn't have acted that way, but OP is in the wrong, too. So yeah, AITA?"
37,"AITA for making my friend sit in the car on a ski trip? So a long time friend and I planned a ski trip to a popular mountain a few hours away. To make a long story short, when his pass gets rejected from the scanner on the second day, it turned out that the mountain only gave him a one day pass while I got the two day that we both thought we had. He had the receipt and they did only charge him for the one day lift ticket, so I'm assuming the ticket people just misheard him or hit the wrong button or something. Obviously this would be a total pain in the ass for anyone, but you would have sworn it was the worst thing that had happened to him in the past year. He threw a goddamn fit in the lift line. Me, being a little bitch for some reason (probably too nervous about confronting a friend, especially with a 4-5 hour drive in front of us), didn't really say anything. I kind of passively agreed with everything he was going on about as if I was only half paying attention. I somehow got dragged in to his plan to go confront the service desk. He did all the talking while I just kind of sheepishly sat there and presented my own lift ticket when he asked. They didn't reimburse him. Instead, he would have had to buy a second one day pass which would have been about $20 more total than just getting the two day pass in the first place. In a final act of angry principal he refused to buy the ticket and starts heading to the car to leave. I guess he expected me to go with him but seeing as how I paid full price and wanted to ride the entire second day (this was at like 10:30), I told him that I was going to stay and ride. He ended up staying in his car (he drove us) for a few hours while I stayed on the mountain. I did come back earlier than I would have otherwise, but I'm sure it was still boring as fuck for him. One thing I will say though, is that he had really been being a jerk for the entire trip. He had bitched about everything from how far the restaurant was from where we were staying, to the people we shared the lift with to how much this mountain sucked compared to the ones he normally goes to. If he hadn't had been such a dick for the past two days I would have been willing to compromise or help him out in some way, but at this point I wasn't feeling too generous towards him. The ride back was pretty awkward. Was I the asshole?"
38,"AItA for using Spotify outside the US, thus listening to music for free and listening to ads not targeted at me? I mean, it makes me feel pretty guilty. I'm Indian and used a combination of Mediahint and a VPN every 15 days to refresh the ""vacation"" time for Spotify. According to Spotify, I'm in the US, and the ads are American too. What gets me though is that none of the products that are advertised on Spotify even come close to bearing relevance for me. ProFlowers advertises a bouquet for an ""offer"" amount of my parents' weekly grocery budget. I could go on listing the ads from McDonald's products that will never be available here to ""superior"" motor oil by some startup introduced by a gruff announcer who sounds like he gargles gears for a living, but accusations of being a shill are never more than the mention of a successful product away. One moment I'm listening to Let it Go for the hundredth time, and when it's done, I listen to one of these ads that is my ""tax"" of sorts for all this legally free music. But it's useless. I'm ripping off talented artists whose income comes majorly from these ads that I couldn't possibly get anywhere by clicking from Madurai. The only price I'm paying is time. Am I the asshole?"
39,"Kids go into empty house next door. AITA for calling the cops? The house next door is vacant. Two weeks ago, I come home and three young males, high school age, come out of the gate on the fence between my home and that house. As they walk away I shout at them that I'm calling the cops if I see them again doing that. They get into a new Camaro that's parked at the end of the street and drive off. I didn't get the plate number. I figure they're in there smoking shit or something. Didn't look thugish. I call security. Just to let them know what happened. They show up with the cops in tow. They go into the house, find all the sliding doors and windows open and close them. This afternoon I see an SUV parked at the same spot. I get suspicious. I peek over the fence and yep, there's a window and a sliding door open. Security says call the cops this time. I come out to wait for the cops and there's the black Camaro with 2 young males in it, just idling by the curb one house down from the vacant one. They drive off. 3 cruisers show up. I explain it's not THAT big a deal, I just want a report filed. Report gets written up. I get a copy. AITA for making a fuzz about some kids going into the house next door to smoke some weed? They didn't look like thugs. Just some kids from the neighborhood. Cops said it reeked the last time when they went in. Just some kids hiding out to smoke some shit. But. This is Miami. We live next to the wall inside a gated community and there's nothing on the other side of the wall but empty lot. We got broken into two years ago. A dude was murdered walking to work one morning less than a mile from our backyard. A couple was killed for their car a half mile down the street from that. You get the picture. The guy across has seen them numerous times going in there and never called security or the cops. This is what's making me doubt myself. Maybe he sees them, figures it pretty harmless and doesn't bother. Cops show up on these kids and they could get arrested, screw up their lives, and for what? for hiding out to smoke some dope? But the house is not theirs. It's vacant. It's private property. Now the windows are open. Anyone can go in there. I'm looking at the window every little knock I hear now. I actually *want* to be the overreacting asshole because that would mean I don't have anything to be so worried about."

41,"Stuck in the middle of my parents messy divorce Not sure if this is exactly the right sub, please redirect me if needed. Okay so for context, I'm a 21 year old male and my parents divorced about 3 years ago after many years of fighting. The divorce has been very ""messy"" with my parents constantly putting me and my 17 year old brother in the middle. Both my brother and I live with my mom and see my dad a few times a week. Both my mom and I work at a hardware store together. My dad came in yesterday, like he usually does every now and then, looking at some clearance items in flooring and decided he wanted to buy some plus order some more. I told him I'd handle it all and call him later. I was told to put his items aside in the back and called him when I left work to let him know. He said he and his girlfriend would come in later that night to make sure she liked everything my dad was planning to purchase. My mom was working at that time so I texted her letting her know they were coming to give her a heads up. Later my mom freaked out saying I shouldn't have brought him to the store, although he came by himself, and I shouldn't help him because of the way he treats her and she let everyone at work know that I don't live with him so if I let him use my discount I would be fired. She also threatened to not come home that night, but she eventually did really late. We've been going back and forth all day. She thinks I should have told my dad not to bring his girlfriend in. My dad isn't a reasonable person so I don't think he'd listen, and I really dont see how I'm supposed to control what he does. I'm also upset that she blames this whole thing on me when it seems like it's a problem between them. I'm also not happy about her airing out our dirty laundry for all our employees to see and also threatening my job.

43,"AITA for refusing to do a bass guitar recording for a friend? This friend of mine is in a band of sorts, but doesn't have a bassist, and so when they need one, they'll usually get someone in as a session player. For this the band shell out a fair sum of money. Now a few months ago, this friend of mine mentioned to me that they were recording again and asked me if I were interested in recording the bass if they needed someone. I said that it sounded a great idea and so we left it at that. At this stage he did mention to me that he'd cover the studio fee for me and that he'd pay me whatever my rate was for the work. Two weeks ago, he emailed me telling me that he'd written this song, which needed a bassist because it was a slap-bass line and he wanted a real bass sound and not a computer playing it. I agreed to do a rough draft recording for him for nothing, as he's a good friend and I thought that with even a really rough recording he would at least be able to get a demo version done and find someone to play it in the studio for the proper version. So I recorded it for him on my own time, sent it to him and thought nothing more about it. Last week he contacted me to tell me they were hitting the studio with the song and asked me if I was interested in doing the session with them playing bass again, this time for real. We discussed the details and I could make the studio date and time and so on. Then I asked him about the money we'd talked about before, and this is when things took a turn. He told me that he'd agreed to pay my studio fee, but that he was hoping that I'd do it for them pretty much 'as a friend' (his words, not mine, meaning he wanted a freebie) because I'd done the draft recording for nothing. I told him that if he wasn't willing to pay me as promised, then not only was I not doing the studio session, but that I wasn't willing to let him use my draft recording either. AITA?"
44,"AITA for bristling at the new guys taking over my project? I'll try to be brief, but it isn't my strong suit. I've worked at the same company for over 5 years as the database reporting guru. Six months ago, we hired on half a dozen new guys to build out Business Intelligence processes. They have not grown on me. I perceive them to be cliquish and always having meetings where nothing gets accomplished. I am more about production and building solid relationships with the business units. The topic at hand is a payroll report that I have spent the past five years on, changing it as the business needs it. I have resisted delegating it to my own team because it's such a business-critical thing. Over the past week, the new guys started working on a payroll report. Their manager (who is mine, too) said they were doing it for a different group that I'm not involved in. Until last night, when he tells me they have finished the payroll report that will replace mine, with very little collaboration from me. I want to swear at him, tell him to go to hell, and complain about going behind my back. I've looked at their code, and it's missing a lot of important pieces that are in mine. As a bonus, they discovered a way around a broken data source that will let me improve mine. It infuriates me. I don't want to come across as a diva and say it has to be done my way or no way, but I really think this was the wrong approach on their part. I *AM* the expert on what Payroll wants, so if they wanted to help, it should have been more collaborative. I feel that I left myself open for questions and discussions. I haven't responded to the email request to look it over and give my critique because I'm afraid I'm going to get emotional and act like a bitch. AITA for getting upset?

A person whom I did not know, but my friend knows responded that my ""white lady entitled intentions and musings were completely full of shit"" How dare I even ""speak about legitimacy"" and how ""noble it was of me not to be a racist and did I want a fucking award for it?"" I did not respond but, she continued to assault me verbally in several more comments afterward, the gist being that I was a racist piece of shit. It really rattled me. Would it have been better to not say anything to my friend? Was it presumptuous of me to even respond? I just wanted my friend to feel like I had her back, was I being entitled by merely addressing the issue? I immediately thought after it happened that I didn't do anything wrong but, then I started to ruminate and now I honestly don't know."
51,"Drama on a Minecraft server I've been a part of this Minecraft economy server for maybe a year and a half. Toward the middle, I started not going on often, maybe once every week or so. I had always thought I knew of ways to improve the server and I mentioned these in the chat. This staff member would disagree and we would talk about it. I always thought these were friendly debates. Fast forward to today, I made some comment about something and he asked me if I had a minute where he could talk to me. He told me I needed to stop complaining and that everyone was talking about how they didn't like me for complaining. This shocked me because I always thought these were group discussions and other community members thought the suggestions were good ideas. I also was shocked because I didn't think I did this often enough where the regular community would notice. I have most of the private messages in an album along with images for a later part of the story. http://imgur.com/a/YzK8E I told him how I was shocked by this and he told me how I should have posted these suggestions on the server forum. One message that was cut off said something like ""I'm not a big fan of the forums and that's just my problem."" He wrapped this conversation up and I went back to doing things. During this time, stuff started to sink in. I decided I would quit the server because I didn't feel welcome. I started selling most of my valuables and plots (since it was an economy server), I said my goodbyes, and left. After this, I went on the server forums and posted a list of my suggestions just like the staff guy said. After a minute or two, it was deleted. I went to the guy's profile and see that he was active so I thought maybe he deleted it and I went to ask him what was wrong with it. You can see this part in the second half of the album. http://imgur.com/a/YzK8E I should mention that this was a high up administrator on the server and the server doesn't allow swearing because really young kids play on there sometimes. So that's the situation, Reddit. Am I the asshole? I know complaining a bunch is really an asshole thing to do but I really didn't know I was offending anyone."
52,"AITA for not wanting to roof? I have a friend who asked me, a few days ago, to help roof his house. I agreed to help. So he calls and asks me to drive an hour to where he lives and start at 9am and work until 2pm. Now I already cleaned and put in a lot of work when he bought that house a few months ago. And cleaned out their family barn for his wedding last fall. For nothing in return. AITA for wanting to just say straight up no? EDIT: Or should i feel bad for wanting to negotiate? Thanks RoonilaWazlib UPDATE: I did it and it was fun and I was probably being kind of a dick for not wanting to. I got pizza and beer."
53,"Made a joke about my dysfunctional family dynamic [So here's the comment] Out of nowhere, this immediately got downvoted into oblivion. My family and I don't get along, but we still value each other as human beings.

54,"AITA for defending Humble Bundle? You can see the thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/26m4dt/bundle_stars_reboot_40_bundle_6_steam_games_for/chsbny2 I linked to the parent comment, the thread goes on pretty deep with all of my comments being downvoted and others being upvoted. So, essentially people have been angry with Humble Bundle lately, because they are not satisfied with Humble Bundle's recent sales and strategies. I don't really mind, because mostly its been great deals. In the discussion, one user posts about how this new bundle in the thread, Bundle Stars, is better than Humble Bundle and then proceeds to post a [photo] that implies Humble Bundle has become a greedy mobster cat (???) that only wants users money. So I simply ask why it has to be a war when they both offer great deals. Then, for some reason, I argue with various users about why I think Humble Bundle is still a good place. I probably should have just let it go, but I really found it weird that people legitimately were HATING on Humble Bundle. I never thought it was a bad thing, I get some bundles from there and they usually have great value and I get to decide where the money goes (developers, charity, or humble bundle). What I didn't expect was to be downvoted so heavily (my top comment is now positive, but the rest are very negative and even that top comment is highly controversial in terms of up/down and it isn't Reddit's algorithm, as it was at -14 earlier). People have even begun to accuse me of being a Humble Bundle employee (I'm not). Am I an asshole for defending a service that I think is good? EDIT: I should probably mention that I legitimately wonder whether or not I should just let this sort of thing go in the future? I saw the other side as being childish, but perhaps I was also childish? Fanboyish? I don't know. It's the internet, this place is weird."
55,"AITA for socially cutting off a roommate/friend who moved out. I lived/live with a decent number of roommates in a big house in a college town. Everybody but a couple living there was on the lease, and we didn't think this would be an issue as we had all been friends for 3 years we trusted everyone in the house, blah blah blah. I should also note that had this couple not agreed to live with us we would not have rented the house due to the rent. Cue the summer, we still have several months on the lease and everyone is graduating and moving on or looking for new jobs. The couple decides that they dont want to live at our place anymore and sign a new lease for the summer without telling anyone. They then tell us that they are going to move out and cant afford to pay rent at both places. According to them this is ok though because they saved us money by agreeing to move into the house with us so rent would be split between more people. I am not going to start a bunch of petty fights while we still have to live together because they are already locked into the new lease and we have no real legal recourse to make them pay rent so I remain civil until they move out, but everyone is pretty pissed off. After they move out I stop answering their calls and texts because I no longer want to be friends with someone who pulls that move. A week after they move out the female in the relationship is blowing up my phone and I ignore her calls. She calls my roommate who is nicer than me and he answers and says he doesnt know why I would be ignoring her calls as that is between us two. She texts me and asks why I am ignoring her. Keep in mind I am almost positive that she is calling because she wants me to hook her up with one of my weed guys as I got a text from her boyfriend asking to buy an OUNCE the day before, but he couldnt afford the rent he skipped out on. I told her unless she was calling to pay us the rent money she fucked us out of, she could fuck off. She called me an asshole. AITA? **TL;DR:Trusted friends, shouldnt have.**"
56,"Friends used same baby name. I had my daughter in December. We named her after my great grandmother, which means a lot to our family. It's a less common name, but not completely obscure. Part of the reason I picked it is because we don't know anyone else (living) with the name and wanted to avoid having 5 of the same name in her class. Two of my friends from high school married each other. Just this weekend their baby is born- and they use the exact same name that we named our daughter. I know both of them. They live around the corner from my parents, go to the same church as them, and I'll probably see them at the same functions fairly often. We have hundreds of mutual friends. We interact online quite a bit. I'm pretty annoyed. Maybe it shouldn't matter, but it feels like they stole our name. TL; DR Two friends used same name as my baby, 6 months later. I'm ticked off. AITA?"
57,"It's the principle.. So to cut a very long story short. A friend of mine owed me some money, not a lot of money but that's not the point. He said he would pay me the same day, good for me because I wasn't particularly well off at the time. So the day comes, his cheque hasn't cleared so he can't pay me, that's fine, I'm a reasonable guy, just pay me when it clear, no problems! You can guess the pattern here, days pass, comes up to a week, I've been sending a text every couple of days to say hey and ask what the update is (at this point I have very little money so I kinda need it back.) I'm being ignored by what i considered a good friend. No responses, on multiple different methods. Phone, Skype, Facebook etc. Eventually I get pissed, I text him telling him I don't care if he wants to ignore me, just pay me my money and I'll leave him alone. He pays me and continues to ignore me to this day. I don't get it, am I the asshole here?"
58,"AITA for refusing to give my cousin a lift? This weekend saw me home alone as my parents were away on a trip. I'd got the weekend off from work and I'd made it known to most of my family that I'd planned to do a number of things (that I'd had planned for some time, it must be said) including going to mosque. Now, it must be said that this was the only weekend I've had off for probably two months. Skip forward to last Saturday, and I was in the next town over, almost 15 miles away, and I got a call on my mobile, from my cousin. He was at some random place back home, and was asking me if I could pick him up. I politely told him I couldn't, as I was at the mosque, and ended the call, suggesting to him that if he wanted to get home, he should catch the bus, whcih to my mind wasn't unreasonable. I then ended the call. Skip forward to 20min later and I got another call from my cousin again, requesting again to get a lift, and I told him exactly the same thi ng as before, and pointed out that he was more than capable at 17years old of getting on a bus or walking home, or that if he so desperately wanted picking up, his dad(my uncle) was nearer to him than I was. I knew from a fact that even if I agreed to pick him up, it'd have been at least 1/2 an hour before I even got back to my home town, and that's assuming I didn't hit traffic or anything. So that evening I was at home when my uncle came into the house, and asked me why I hadn't picked my cousin up. I told him what I'd already told my cousin, and pointed out that this weekend was the only time I'd had Saturday off for months to do the things I'd personally like to be doing, and in this case, stuff I'd planned and made known to him and others for ages. He then started giving me some crap about me 'being selfish' and how I only seemed to think of myself, conveniently ignoring the fact that there have been times in the past when I have actually had done stuff for my cousin. So, AITA?"
59,"Would you consider this animal abuse? Me my gf and my brother's fiance have been hand rearing kittens since the mother died when the kittens were 2 weeks old. They are now 8 weeks old. My brother's fiance's mom was told to come and feed the kittens at 10 before she was going to work.I'd feed them the other times during the day as they need to be fed every three hours. Keep in mind, these aren't my kittens the mother was not my cat. I plan on keeping one of the kittens other then that it shouldn't be my problem. I've been feeding and bathing them while they are at work. Monday me and my gf walk in on this http://imgur.com/a/VASih and spent 3 hours between going to walmart and buying them two smaller litter boxes so they'd be easier to clean. Cleaning supplies to sanitize the area. Cat food for them because they have diarrhea and I thought reverting back to the old brand would be better for them. Bathed them cleaned everything. It took 3 hours to do, three hours in the middle of the day when I wanted to do other things. I've also bought a majority of their food. Watched them over a long weekend while they were at the coast. Took them to the vet for them. My gf went to work, my brother came home. Told him that me and my gf were pissed, her especially about how bad things were. He asked if he should apologize. I said yeah. Then he started getting pissed and defensive saying he shouldn't appologize to my girlfriend for the way HE raises HIS cats. I say, well you should appologize to her because we spent three hours today cleaning up shit, litterally, that wasn't our fucking mess. He said ""well you chose to do that, you didn't have to."" I told him, no conscionable human being would leave animals in that condition a second longer. He said ""look, they have diarhea and they shit and they leave paw prints of shit places. We clean it daily."" Told him ""If I walked in on that at someone else's house, I'd of called the cops."" He said he's not going to appologize. Yesterday his fiance was slamming doors that morning at 7am. I left to do stuff came back at 7pm. Went straight to the kitties room. It was clean but they forgot to fill up their water bowl. Went to my room didn't talk to them. Wednesday, (today) his fiance comes in. My gf is here today, wasn't yesterday. Says we have no right to call her neglectful that they clean their room daily. That she woke up and there was a couple shits in the shower but that she had to work and she'd figure we'd clean it when we woke up and that she is not going to appologize. The future sister in law was raising her voice and didn't let my gf speak more then a couple words and had a look of crazy on her"

61,"AITA for going against my manager? This will likely be slightly complicated. Here goes. I'm Muslim, and originally when I began my present job, I was not wearing my headscarf (hijab) for a variety of reasons. However at interview, I asked whether it would be possible for me to wear it should I choose to so, and I was told that I could. SKip forward to 6 months ago and we had a manager who I'll call 'M'. He was a really cool manager, and one day he asked me for a meeting. It turned out he knew little to nothing about Islam or hijab, and so he asked me if I could give him something of a schooling in my beliefs and also about hijab. I did so and he gave me the thumbs-up to wear it to work, as did the assistant manager Q. **Enter manager P** M left, and was replaced by 'P', the current manager. One day, as I was coming in, she requested a talk two months ago with me. She wanted a talk with me about my hijab, and we went to the manager's office to do so. She brought up the fact that I wasn't wearing it all the time at work (which I didn't for my own personal reasons). I told her about my reasons, and also the fact that manager M had already discussed this with me along with Q, and she cut me off, telling me that this wasn't their decision to make, and that he should have asked HR. I pointed out that I'd already asked at interview about this and they'd also told me the same thing. She just cut me off and told me I wasn't to wear it to work until HR had been contacted, which from what she was saying, was something she would do. **Meeting 2** Last week, I wore my hijab again, as I had guessed everything had been sorted out with HR by my manager, and if anything had been a problem, someone would have said something. In this case, I went in and within 5min of me getting there, my manager phoned for me to go to the office. I knew automatically what this was about, and when I went in, I asked right off the bat whether she had contacted HR as she said in the last meeting. She then told me that she'd actually said that it was **me** who needed to contact HR in that meeting (she didn't, and I've got a good memory for this stuff) and then went on about how I was 'defying her authority' and all this. Now I've searched through the company rules (took me close to 3 hours) regarding equality policies, dress codes and health and safety, and I can't find how I'm breaking any rule in any way. So, am I being an asshole?"
62,AITA getting kicked out of a grocery store just for being a teenager So there is a grocery store near my school that a lot of kids go to. Today I was there with some friends like any other day and we were looking at chips to buy. After about 5 minutes of deliberation (we weren't being loud or rowdy or anything) one of the managers comes up and tells us to get out for taking to long. I try and reason and say that we were just about to go to the till but he says no and physically pushes me towards the door. I got mad and called him an asshole so he told me to never come back and I flipped him off as I left. Am I the asshole? TL:DR guy kicks us out for no reason I call him an asshole/flip him off
63,"AITA: My friend's mother died after a year long battle with cancer. I avoided his call today because I know he needs to talk to someone, but I don't feel emotionally equipped to help him. He's pretty much a mess. He's been an alcoholic for the least few years. His wife has lung cancer and his mother just died from a similar disease. This yet he smokes several packs a day himself. I'm one of the only people he knows and trusts to talk to, but sometimes I just find it too much. Thoughts?"
64,"For trying to get a Starbucks barista fired I always get a quarter pound of espresso because I like my coffee to be fresh. This barista at my local Starbucks has given me less than quarter pound EVERY TIME he's served me. Quarter pound is 112grams. On one occasion he gave me 30g, then i went back and he gave me 80g, and went back and he gave me 105g. This has happened 4 times now (over the span of 6 months). And every time I confront him about it he gives me attitude and tells me that the scale is correct, and I end up having to argue with him. Yesterday he refused to give me more (I weighed 102g). I know that their scale can be faulty, as I've been told by other baristas there ... but this guy treats me as if I'm some sort of cheap dumbass trying to screw Starbucks. It's not even about the money for me. Quarter pound of espresso is under 5$. I have left bigger tips than that for baristas.... It's the principle of the matter and the guy's attitude that bothers me, and the fact that I always ask so politely. He doesn't realize that I am a Starbucks veteran (was a barista for 3 years) and that I have a very accurate scale at home that I use often and that I have a pretty good sense of weight/volume of ground coffee. I'm on a war path to get this bastard fired. Am I an asshole?"

66,"Comment I made in class. In speech class last week we did a group presentation on disasters. One guy in my group covered Centralia, Pennsylvania and the town's coal mine fires. After our speeches, we asked if there were any questions from the audience. One young lady in the class was asking about Centralia. She said things like, ""I don't get why they can't put the fires out. Aren't there enough fire extinguishers? I don't see why they couldn't stop it."" I replied with what I thought was a logical, concise answer, ""Obviously if there were a way to stop it, they would have done it."" To my surprise, the rest of the class laughed at her, and she became very embarrassed. I felt bad about her embarrassment, but at the same time, I just can't seem to see how I did something wrong."
67,"AITA for refusing to drive my mother back from a party? Two weeks ago I went to a party which was being held by a family friend. I went, along with my mother, and I drove everyone there in my car. The event wasn't that far from my house, about 5 miles away. During the course of the night my mother proceeded to get pretty drunk. She'd began with a couple of glasses of wine, which I personally didn't give a toss about, but by the end of the night she was wrecked drunk, having drunk a lot of whiskey, and was shouting and screaming and just generally being totally fucking annoying. She also proceeded to argue with two people at the party, pissing them off, over some totally ridiculous thing she said (still not too sure what she said though). So skip forward to the end of the night, around midnight, and it was time for people to leave. At this point, I told my mother that if she wanted to get home, she could get a taxi home, as there was no way on heaven or earth I was dealing with her idiotic behaviour. If anything, I'm not that confident driving at night, and having a drunk idiot to deal with would only make things harder. But this isn't the first time she's done this either. There was an almost exact same time when she did the same at a family wedding, having become similarly plastered drunk, despite warnings from various family members, including my uncle whose car myself and my mother were travelling in, not to do so. I choose not to go out with her socially because I know all she's interested in is getting as shitfaced as possible. This is a 44 year old woman and her attitude of getting wrecked as fast as possible is more fitting for a kid. The next morning, I got a metric ton of grief from my mother, who **demanded** that I give back to her the money she spent on a taxi home, and she kicked off about how I'd 'dumped' her and how she was 'just having some fun' and how I was 'being an asshole' for leaving her. I pointed out to her that I wasn't responsible for her behaviour and wasn't there just to act like some glorified babysitter for her to act like an A-grade moron, given I wanted to enjoy myself too. I should add as a last note that I am **not** against anyone drinking, and the alcohol isn't really an issue for me. I personally couldn't give a toss whether someone wants to drink or not. What I do have a problem is stupid behaviour. So, AITA or my mother here?"
68,"AITA for forgetting to take my friend to the grocery store before going camping? I invited my friend to go in a weekend camping trip, along with her son. I was accompanied by my child, and my husband joined us the next day. It was a three hour drive to the campsite, so we stopped along the way to have dinner at my in laws, who live nearby. My friend and her son didn't like the dinner (spaghetti), so I ran to the store to get him mac and cheese. At that time, I asked if she wanted to go with me, since she had told me she needed groceries. She hemmed and hawed and finally said no, we can go later. So, we eat dinner, and then decide to leave asap, since it will be getting dark in a few hours and we wanted to get set up in daylight. At this point I made my fatal error. I forgot to go to the grocery store. Along the way, my friend mentions this...but at this point we are no longer near a grocery store, so I stop at Sheetz, which is a large gas/convenience store. She gets her stuff, we go to the campsite and set up. For the entire weekend she proceeds to complain about not having food, even though my husband stopped at the store and got her food that she requested, as well as the fact that the campout we went to had plenty of food, there was a potluck breakfast, and I went searching for food that she wanted and found it. Still not enough. Might I mention that her son didn't give a crap about the food, he was only stressed because she was making him stressed, imo.. we didn't speak for a week afterwards, and when we did hang out, she proceeds to tell me how I fucked up her weekend. I cry, then leave. Tl;dr I forgot to take my friend to the store, she proceeds to ruin my trip, says its all my fault. Edit: I had packed lots of food, which she also refused to eat...but she drank our beer and left half bottles of it everywhere. I didn't ask her for any gas money, or money for the campout. She did buy the weed though."

72,"I called out my cousin when he said my brother didn't care about calories First off, my cousin is a dick to my little brother. He's always saying ""man you eat so much,"" or, ""maybe you're just mad because you're hungry,"" in a very condescending way. I'll admit, my brother does eat a bit too much and is overweight. But here's the thing, my cousin is morbidly obese. My guess is 350 pounds. So the other night, we were all having tea. My brother was eating a zebra cake, but he hadn't had one in years, so he was really liking it. But then he saw we had bread, so he put down the zebra cake so he could have bread instead. My sister asks, ""why don't you just eat both?"" And he replies ""Too many calories."" All of a sudden, my cousin says, ""you were just eating a zebra cake, you obviously don't care about calories."" I was mad. The only thing I hate more than hypocrites are racists. I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was something along the lines of ""Shut up about calories when you're talking to him. Look at yourself for once! Jesus!"" Yeah, that seemed to do the trick. He shut up, and didn't say a word for the rest of, the tea time. Then he moped around, acting like I insulted him for no reason. I know you might be thinking, ""maybe he is just looking out for your brother,"" but no. He said it in the same condescending way as usual. Am I the asshole or is he?"
73,"Did I do the right thing? Very sad LDR breakup story, I'm feeling like the scum of the earth right now I posted this in TwoXChromosomes but I think maybe this is a good place for advice too... My boyfriend (we will call him Rex) and I had been dating almost 2 years. The first year, I was a senior in college and he had graduated a year earlier and co-founded a startup. Of the guys I'd dated, he was the most put-together, the most reliable, the most attractive, the LEAST argumentative (we never ever fought), and I felt had the most potential. At the end of the day though, I felt as if he didn't ""get me"" like my other partners had, but as it was his first real relationship I decided not to give up on this great guy. Upon graduation, I was offered a job 900 miles away. Rex had his company back home and couldn't leave. I wanted to break it off right then and save myself the pain, but he and his sweet words convinced me we could make it work. Neither of us believes in soulmates so we thought if we put in the work we could make it happen. I moved, he stayed, and our long-distance relationship began. And by LDR, I mean my chronic loneliness. I am not an outgoing person, I didn't know a single person in the whole state, I walked into my empty apartment crying almost every day, and I clung to Rex for comfort. We alternate turns to take a flight and got to see each other maybe every other month. He truly tried to be there for me, but those happy weekends when he came down would only make me sadder when he left again. He said what he could but I knew my depression was wearing on him and us. At one point he told me just to stop talking about sad things. I knew I had to turn things around, and luckily I was at a company full of young transplants like me, so I began forcing myself to go out on weekends. I flourished. I made friends, got to know the new city, and was finally smiling again. The problem with this new life was that Rex wasn't a part of it. He didn't know the people I talked about and couldn't relate to the culture I was now a part of. I live in an awesome place, and when I would tell him about the fun times I was having I felt like I was rubbing it in his face. I felt completely torn; like I had to choose between a life of sadness with Rex and a life of happiness without him. FF to this January–I was laid off from my amazing job. I got a freelance gig to pay rent while I found a new job while all those friends I made moved away. By this time things were worse with Rex.

74,"AITA in this altercation with my father? I will try to provide as much context as possible to present the story in an unbiased way. I come from a very conservative Christian family that raised me up through private school with the sole intention of me going to a 4 year college. I have always known that this is not the career path that I wanted to take, but in fear of disappointing them, I never told them and ended up actually attending a semester at a very nice college with the hope that it would grow on me. It only made me even more sure of my decision to quit and go into a field that only requires specific training. My mom was understanding and more supportive than my dad, who has never been the same since. Everything up to this point only serves as contet for the actual altercation. I was 18 when this happened. I had been home for a couple of months and searching for a part-time job by my parents' demand. I was sending out dozens of applications, but my complete lack of prior experience was making it difficult to even get a call back. One day my dad gets home from buying pool chemicals and tells me that they had a help wanted sign on the door and for me to apply online for it immediately. I didn't have a problem with this, so I went to the website to check the listing. It was a 21+ management position. Later, he asked me if I applied, and I told him that I was underage and not qualified so I didn't bother. This made him very angry, telling me that I would do what he said and to send in the application anyway. I repeated that I was 18 and have never had a real job before, much less a management position. We argued back and forth with the same thing for a bit and it eventually came to him saying ""I'll just apply for you. Give me your resume and be quiet."" I said ""I don't have one, so you'll be sending in nothing,"" to which he replied ""Don't be a smart ass."" A little more context to go with the first bit: I had heard my father curse only once before this, and it was after a severe injury, so this marked a serious escalation in the seriousness of situation where my family is concerned. The tone he used in saying this was very agressive and threatening, so my 18 year old reaction was that I wasn't going to take verbal abuse from anyone, so I said ""Was the language supposed to drive the point across harder?"" And this broke him. He got up from his chair and started walking toward me saying ""How about I beat your ass right now?"" My adrenaline replied ""Do you want to try?"" At this point my mom ran in screaming at my dad to stop, and he backed away from me but continued to the heart of what"
75,"ATIA asked friends to do wedding photos, they throw out large number, I go with a different photographer, now they are upset. Back-story: I worked with the male part of this particular couple at a retail store. We had a pretty good friendship, but ultimately, I ended up going above and beyond quite often. I have gotten up after 2 am on a couple of occasions to rescue them because they can't drive (they still do illegally on occasion, hence why I would have to rescue them...one got caught and I have to take the other to jail to bail them out and drive them home). I even let them live with me for a period of time because they got suddenly kicked out of their place. I don't think I have been in a spot where I needed them in any type of emergency situation, but I don't think I hold that against them. Fast-forward to modern times: My fiance and I hang with them about once or twice every two months. Not very often. I asked if they would be interested in taking photos for our wedding, to which they gladly agreed. We hadn't talked pricing or anything yet, though I expected it soon. Two months go by and not a word from them. I reach out and we hang again, I bring up the wedding photos again with them. This time they have a ""guesstimate"" number. They say $1000 is normal, but they would only charge me $500. My friend photographer has yet to graduate from film school and has never shot a wedding before in his life. My fiance and I discuss the offer and decide to try to work it down to $400 instead of $500. We try to set up a time to meet at the venue to discuss photo opportunities. Anytime we are busy, seems to be the times they are wanting to meet up. As if trying to postpone going to the venue. I had to practically beg them to even go in the first place. The female didn't think they should have to go at all. We are now under a month from our wedding and still no set in stone photographer for our wedding. We decided to check thumbtack. We found a photographer for $400, she set up a time to meet at the venue, sent a contract, and a questionnaire within a few hours of us responding. My friends had done none of this. I text them to say that I don't think we could afford their prices and that with a wedding coming up, things are getting hectic and it makes it difficult to plan open times to meet for us. I get a 7 message text discussing how we will not find a better deal then them, and how they were trying to ""help us out"" and how they were putting their schedule around ours just to do this. Basically, calling me a dick for not using their services. I am quite upset now. I haven't decided what to"
76,"AITA because I am upset she let her sister stay in the house without asking me? So the SO had recently moved into a new apt. She is trying to make this our home and get me to spend more time there. I am with it. I have been investing time and money into it. And also started bringing some of my things there. So she has to go away for work for 2 weeks. The plan was that I would spend most of the time there. Still staying at my home for 2 or 3 nights to get to work faster. So. I get this phone call. Her estranged sister has just been assaulted by her bf. I need to go downstairs and give her mother the keys to the house so her and her son can stay over. I am pissed. Firstly, this woman has all but avoided her family and kept this kid away for years. Now this person who has been described as irresponsible is now going to be staying in this apt. Unsupervised. With a toddler. For what is supposed to be 3 days (I know it will be longer). Now AITA because I'm upset that she made this decision without my consultation? Without my input? This dwelling that's supposed to be ours except when it's convenient for it not to be is now once again her house. It wasn't an emergency anymore. This even happened the night before. More than enough time to call me and ask for my input. It's not that I am put out. I'm just annoyed that she went to save this person who has been less than sisterly to her and has been known to screw up crap alone in ""our"" apt. Oh and I forgot to mention I was asked by her mother to ""examine"" the sister to see if her nose is broken. Right. On my off time I am now giving medical advice like a doctor that has medical equipment and a degree. (I am a paramedic) Honest input please?"
77,"AITA for confronting a group of teenagers? This one happened a couple of days ago. I was in the main shopping street in my town and about halfway down the pedestrianized section, there's a seating area consisting of big stone blocks for seating. Now I am Muslim and I was, at the time, wearing an abaya (long dress), hijab and a faceveil (niqab, which isn't unusual around here). I don't make a habit to wear the face veil all the time but this day I had chosen to do so. I was walking down towards this seating area and when I got there, I decided to take 5min and sit down. To my left there were a group of teenage boys, who I heard making the usual remarks (which I was totally expecting and so ignored). After a couple of minutes my attention was drawn back to this group, as I heard two of them discussing whether they should rip my veil off my head, because 'it would be funny'. Then someone else in the group I could hear was asking his friends if they had a lighter, so he could set my headscarf and veil on fire. At this point I really lost it. I marched over to where they were sitting and confronted them, telling them (or more accurately, shouting at them) that not only was I not deaf because I had the niqab on, and so had heard every word they'd said, and that if they tried anything I would personally ensure they would feel pain. Now I feel I may have acted a little asshole-ish, and so I leave it to reddit to decide."
78,"AITA for calling out a smoker? A few days ago I was out walking my dog at the park. My dog stops beside a bench and begins sniffing around. I thought she was looking for a place to go and so I begin to look in my bag just in case she had some business for me. All of a sudden I hear her yelp, and she begins crying so I pick her up to console her. Then I look over and see that she burned her nose on a cigarette butt (or bud, I don't know). I automatically assume that it belonged to the man who was sitting on the bench smoking so I tell him, ""Hey buddy, why don't you pick up your trash? My dog just burnt her nose on that."" His response, ""Maybe you should pay attention to what your dog is doing."" Which made me a little mad. So my response, ""The trash can is literally 4 feet away from you. Are you so fucking fat and lazy that you can't throw your trash away?"" I then picked up the butt/bud, tossed it into the trash and storm off. I now realize I could have handled that differently, and also that it may not have even been his. Or maybe I should have kept an eye on my dog. So am I the asshole?"
79,"AITA for getting mad about my boyfriend going ton a fishing trip? **The background:** I've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and we are moving in together in the fall for school. He currently lives with his parents in a city about 3 hours away from our university, and I live with mine on the opposite side of the country. He has been in a bad financial situation after wrecking his car, and his construction work hasn't been giving him many hours. Whenever I talk to him he is always talking about his ""lazy days"" where he gets stoned and drunk and plays halo all day. Since I moved back to my city I've been working a full time and a part time job, and haven't gotten time off to visit him like I did last summer. In order to lock down a place for us to live in September I had asked him to check out places. I had looked online and emailed landlords, but he didn't have a car to go down to check them out. He got a ride once with his dad who goes down 2-3 times a week and looked at one place. I'm supposed to move out there in 2 weeks **The incident in question:** A couple days ago I was talking to him on one of his ""lazy days."" I was already pissy before I talked to him cause of work bullshit, but I asked him why he wasn't looking for places to live when his dad was down in our uni town. He said he ""wants a lazy day before he goes on his trip"" I asked him what trip he was talking about and he said he had decided to go on a two week long fishing trip with his buddy on his commercial tuna fishing boat. I flipped out and told him I was really worried about finding a place to live and now he's gone for two weeks and I'm supposed to move out there in two weeks. He said his dad could look at houses and he needed this trip to make money. I was yelling at him and telling him he was immature and that me and his dad was doing more to help us find a place then he did. He said he really needs the money and he's gonna make a lot as a deck hand. I said he was ""an asshole and being really immature and had been lazy and irresponsible all summer and that I would just find a place by myself and he could find his own place or sleep on the street cause he's too much of a baby to figure his shit out"" he told me it works both ways and if I had come to visit him we could have found a place earlier. More swearing and name calling back on forth until he hung up on me. Now he's gone for ~2 weeks. I know he needs the money, so am I the asshole? TL;DR: broke boyfriend needs fish,"
80,"AITA for shouting at this woman about her kids in a supermarket? I was in my local Lidl supermarket this morning when this happened. Now anyone who's been in a Lidl knows that the shop isn't that big, and my local one is probably no more than 4 long aisles. I went in and I noticed up ahead that a woman had come in with 3 kids, one of which was a baby in a pram she was pushing. Another two kids were basically running up and down the aisles making pests of themselves and getting under people's feet, which annoyed me in its own right. A couple of times they collided with me or came close to being whacked with a trolley. The mother was nowhere to be seen. I got to the third or so aisle down and I was stood at a freezer, trying to find something. Now as I stepped backwards to return to my trolley, one of these kids came belting down and crashed straight into me, and she went flying a good couple of feet backwards. She began absolutely screaming the place down, and at this point the mother came over and the fun started. Mother: ''Well, aren't you going to apologize?!'' Me: ''Excuse me?'' Mother: ''You knocked my little girl over!'' Me: ''Yes, I did. However if you'd bothered to supervise her and keep her from running around the store getting in everyone's way, that wouldn't have happened. Your kid isn't special in this regard'' Mother: ''How dare you! I've got as much right to be with my kids as anyone!'' Me: ''I'm not saying anything to the contrary. However you are a **parent** and so it seems that you haven't taught your children, any of them, basic courtesy for others. This is a supermarket, not a playground, and so I have a reasonable expectation of being able to shop without a game of human pinball!'' At this point I just walked off and did the rest of my shopping. So reddit, who was the asshole here?"
81,"Guy I live with says he doesn't care about my opinion, I got pissed. AItA? So I'm 21 and doing a summer internship away from home. I've been living in a house belonging to an old man in his seventies. Last night I was talking with him, which is always just me asking him questions and him answering. I finally asked him why he doesn't ask me anything or try to invite me to the conversation at all, and he told me that I was too young for my thoughts to be of any interest to him. I got upset with that and we had a brief fight followed by me going back to my room. I still feel like he's a dick. Am I the asshole?"

My SO and son are disgusted by this. Last week my SO brought a coworker to our home to use the bathroom because the co worker had to pee real bad. What evs. I'm reading upstairs. My SO comes running up stairs red in the face and pissed. When I heard the toilet flush I knew why. "" why in the fuck are you such a nasty bitch?!!""' He asked me this all huffy. "" you must have had corn because it was all in the bowl ( toilet bowl) among 2 feet of shit"" he was embarrassed and I didn't say anything. Why can't my son and SO just flush before they use the toilet if it's such a big friggin deal. And as far as the co-worker - I'm sure he has seen shit before. 💩"
83,"AITA for accidentally mis-grouping my friend's religious beliefs? So, a bit of backstory. Said friend - referred to as J - has been known in our social circle as an atheist since at least the seventh grade. J has always been very open with it - me, him and our friends have always made jokes about it and religion in general when religious people weren't around (we aren't the type to bemoan people for their religion.) Hell, in grade 10 he nearly got mugged for saying that he believed God didn't exist. So, flash forward to today. I was talking to his girlfriend, R, during class. R is a very religious, girly, powder-puff Southern girl, which we've all found ironic considering what we thought to be true. I mentioned offhandedly that he wasn't very religious when we were referring to a teacher of ours that would constantly insert religious references into her teaching. R had said that J didn't care for that teacher very much, and I mentioned it was probably because of said references due to his beliefs. R seemed shocked, and said, ""But J goes to church with me!"" I was shocked, but then I said, ""That's odd, because J regularly hangs out with (other friends, all non-religious) and I and we always shoot the shit about it."" She got visibly very sour and said ""Well, I don't want him hanging around you guys! I'm gonna yell at him."" In between classes, I sent him a text saying that I think I fucked up, I thought R was mad at him and that I think she hated me now. Shortly after, I see them speaking in the middle of campus, and J looks over to me and approaches me. ""So, Tazmily228. First off, you're a dick."" J is/was a good friend of mine, so all I said was ""Okay."" for fear of turning it into an argument. ""Second: When was the last time I spoke to you about my personal life?"" In this instance I assumed his religious beliefs, and I responded, ""About a month ago at A's house when we were playing DnD.' Indeed, we had been shooting the shit about religion and discussing it over pizza during a late-night DnD session. J responded, ""Well, you don't know anything about my personal life, so I advise you stay out of it."" And walked off and sat down with R. I don't know what I did. I didn't intend to offend anybody, and if J suddenly became a Christian, he didn't tell me - or anybody. I asked several of our mutual friends/acquaintances about it and they all responded ""J isn't religious at all."" or some variant. Am I the asshole for assuming, given *strong* evidence?"
84,"AITA for kicking our friends out of the hotel? So yesterday was my boyfriends birthday. Our two friends, him and I got a hotel room with two beds. Our other friends from work (some of them have also been friends with my boyfriend for a long time kind of invited themselves because they wanted to hang out with him and we just told them to get a room next door (total of like 8 people). The room was $140. They decide they don't want to get it and they'll just come downtown and go home. Then they want to drink in our room before we go out, I told them to bring their own alcohol because I got two somewhat nice bottles and it wasn't enough for everyone (they also never pitch in for like anything, always claim their poor but most of them make even more than I do). They get there and they brought a handle of Smirnoff (cheap vodka). My boyfriend ended up getting too drunk to go out, they still want to go and ask if they can stay in our room because they can't afford their own. This really pisses me off because there's eight of them, it's not that expensive to split $140 and there was not enough room in ours (12 people total). They invited more people without telling us (one who my boyfriend really doesn't get along with) and said they would give us some money if they could all sleep on the floor. We ended up kicking them out. They were all really pissed and said they would get a room somewhere else. They drank all our alcohol and I think they even took a bottle of my wine with them. They took the alcohol they brought as well, which is fine I'm just mad they drank all of ours because I wanted some of it for today. I feel bad but I wasn't trying to have a huge party in the room and I didn't want to deal with them all being drunk when they got back when we were just trying to have a calm night. Similar stuff has happened on multiple occasions because they ""don't have money"" ever. I think my boyfriend probably would have let them stay but I don't think it's fair they act like that. Tldr: 8 friends came to our hotel room, didn't want to get their own after we told them to, drank all our alcohol and are mad because I told them to leave after my boyfriend got way too drunk"
85,"Aita for being hurt when my best friend says she needs to talk to me but ends up blowing me off? Disclaimer: all convo is what I remember. It is not exact. This happened about 8 mos ago and my memory is not exact. I have felt bad about it ever since. I really want her involved in my wedding and hate to think about her not coming.... So im getting married next year. My friend (A) and I have been friend for nearly 15 years. I told her about it and asked if shed like to be my maid of honor. She told me that untill she met him and talked to me about it she didnt want to make a choice. Ok, no biggie. Lets see if we can make plans. Hes only free weekends, and he works late into the night. She is the opposite. She is unwilling to give up her free time during the weekend ( which admittedly is very little) and when asked if she would be ok with just talking to me she said fine. So I tell her when im comming up next ( I live two hours out of town) and ask if we could meet up. We pick a day and she says shell text me when shes free. At 5 pm she texts me telling me she cant meet today. Im slitly irritated because I had other things that needed to get done but didnt because I didnt want to miss her. I didnt let it show because I figured it wasnt all her fault. Her job keeps her late and the ride home is over an hour. Anyway everyday for the rest of the week I ask if shes free. Everyday she eventually says no. Saturday rolls arou d and she says no but we can tomorrow. Sunday in the am I send her a text asking for a time and a place and I get no response. Nothing. I ask again four hours later and still nothing. Finally at seven pm she texts saying sorry but its no happening. I got pissed. So I said A"", ive been here a week trying to meet eith you to discuss this. I dont understand why youve put me off. We agreed on this. I dont even understand why you need this to happen. My fiance is a good man. Why would you doubt that?"" I got a garbled response about how my fiance had nothing to do with it and how she just needed to know. Know what I dont know.

As a side note, while weve been friends for around 15 years, we have not been together all that time. We are both individual people, and we know that.

86,"AITA for not letting my friend live with me for a week? First of all, I'd like to apologise if I make any grammar mistakes as English is not my native language. I'm a university student and during the year I live in a university residence, which has about 200 students on it. The rooms are shared with another student. In my case, I share it with a good friend of mine (we'll call him B), and this will be the second year of we living in that residence. Now that University is starting (I will go to the residence next weekend), another friend (he'll be H) who I knew from the residence last year and we were in the same friend group has to take some exams next week. All in all, H has to stay from Sept 6th to Sept 13th. He asked if he could stay with me and B during this week (we can bring an extra mattress). What bothers me about he staying is that while me and B are at the university (we will have several mornings&afternoons occupied), H will do whatever he wants inside me and B's house, and while I trust him, I don't like the idea. Me and B said to him that we couldn't host him for a week, especially because it's against the residence rules, and therefore we couldn't have 3 keys to the room (plus what are we doing could bring us trouble). Are we the assholes for not letting he stay?"
87,"AITA to be angry about this situation regarding a car sale? Or is the buyer to blame? 4 weeks ago I agreed to sell my old car to someone I'll call R, who I knew via family members. He saw the car and liked it straight away, and was happy with my asking price of £200. Everything went fine until this week, when I finally handed over the keys to the old car, having got the new one (yay!), and thought that was the end of it. Now at this time, we agreed that he would give me a deposit of £100, with me giving him a couple of weeks until he'd pay me the rest. This was fair enough as I know him well and knew he wouldn't mess me around. Then a few days ago, I got a call. R had taken the car for a look over by a mechanic and was banging on about how it was going to cost £X to repair Y and £X to repair Z. Now at the time he first saw the car, I had pointed out to him that the car was in need of some attention, and he had still chosen to buy it. Similarly, I'd offered the car at a massive discount to offset the money which would need to be spent on it in terms of maintenance, and this was again something I mentioned to him at the time. Then there was the debacle over the tax disc. I'd initially wanted the car to be out of my hands a lot sooner than it did, and if it had, the tax disc wouldn't have been something I'd have had to deal with, as the car's ownership documents would have been transferred into the new owner's name and so this would have been something they'd have had to do (costing another £100). But because the car sold when it did, there was a massive amount of confusion about who should pay for the disc and when. Eventually I agreed to do it and paid, but that left me minus £100 I should have had. I had hoped in this case that the £100 that R had given me for the deposit would ensure at least that I broke even after paying for the tax disc, but that's when the other problem started. R phoned me and started dropping hints about how much the repairs were going to be and how he'd have to make a payment plan with the mechanic to cover it. Now to my mind, anyone who owns a car has to take some responsibility for the costs of doing so. I couldn't see why I should be flinging money at a car I didn't even own any more. But he wouldn't get off my case and so I agreed with him he could have the £100 deposit back towards the costs, but he would still owe me the rest of the money. So now I'm going to walk away from this deal with pretty much nothing because"

89,"AITA For wanting to fire my lawyer? So a bit of backstory in May of this year I was involved in a wreck where I was hit by a drunk driver and then she hauled ass off in her truck and hit a light pole about a mile down the road and was arrested. So since then I have had to go to physical therapy for several months out of my pocket until I can get reimbursed (I've spent almost $1000 just on that and Dr visits and I only make $8.12/hr) anyways I always took solace in the fact that she was in jail for what she did I looked up her arrest record to find out that less than a year ago she had received another sui charge and had her liscense suspended. So after dealing with the insurance company for about 2 months I decided that I should get a lawyer come to find out that she got charged with dui, driving with a suspended license and failure to yield. She was found not guilty of everything but the failure to yield so I'm fucking pissed about that already. Now here's where the new thing happened I checked my email this morning and saw I got an email from my lawyer and it read "" Good morning vapormaker843: I received a call this morning from Progressive advising that this claim was not reported to them until they received my letter. They are asking for an explanation as to why the claim was not reported at the time of the accident. Can you please update me in this regard? Thank you for your continued cooperation and I will anticipate your expeditious response."" Now please know neither me not the drunk idiot have progressive as put insurance provider. So why is my lawyer sending out personal information about me to a company that has nothing to do with them. And more importantly they are taking 33% or whatever I win so I'm paying them a third of my money and they can't even send the paperwork to the right insurance company. So is sent her back an email saying this ""Good afternoon ms. Lawyerlady, So I'm trying to figure out why progressive got sent anything at all? I have ""a good neighbor"" as my insurance provider and ms. Drunk idiot's insurance provider ""is on her side"". No one involved in the accident has progressive. So if you could please help clear this up I would appreciate it."" That was about as nice as I could word it. ( I still think I was. a bit too polite but I was raised to always treat people how you would like to be treated thanks southern hospitality!)

(Not sure how but I forgot to give the griptape guy the 15 when I met up with him and so did he) I ask my buddy for my twenty back about 4-5 days after I lend it to him, he says if I want my money, I have to go to a local skatepark and ask people if they want a type of drug he had, since he's into a bunch of various drugs. I tell him no, basically said that's not my responsibility and I shouldn't have to do this to get my money back. (Keep in mind he's being fairly vague until now. It took about 3 texts for me to understand one thing he was sayin.) He then tells me he'll give me $8 to pay back the griptape guy. (Which is weird because I would've been paying the griptape guy back with my friends money, and I don't know who would owe who.) I was getting pretty mad at him and being pretty blunt, so once I understood, I apologized. I told him I was sorry for blowing up and that I misunderstood. He then texts me saying ""lol you only text me when you need something"" and asking if I talk Shit about him to my real friends (that came out of the blue I don't even fuckin know) this is the second time I've texted him to ask for my money. And this is the first situation I've actually needed something from him. I also tell him I don't talk shit about him to anyone, and I say bring me my money Monday, end of story. (I usually don't freak out about money but he went on for 10 minutes before I leant it to him about how ""I can trust him"" and ""it's him, he won't Fuck me over.) he goes on about how I needed to go to my friends house, (the guy that owes me money is not friends with him anymore, longer story.) get my friend that owes me his grinder, and not to come back without it and that he won't have my money Monday. I don't reply because, fuck that. No money, No grinder. He then asks if I want a $20 bill, I say two fives and a ten, he says ""do you know what friendship is?"" I say ""obviously I do"" because I'm pretty Pissed at that point, and that's the end. I still don't know if he's gonna give me back the money. Again, usually wouldn't make a big deal, but the guy I owe $15 is a local business man, and I've bought multiple sheets of griptape from him, he's a good dude, and"
91,"AITA for planning on withholding my brother's video game? Here's some backstory: A couple months back I bought an XBOX 360 controller since our other ones are kind of crappy. I bought it for $30. The controller worked fine, however, I instructed my brothers that under no circumstances are they to use this without my permission (because they are known to leave things around/break them). Lo and behold, I find one using the controller without my consent. Because I wasn't particularly pissy that day, I told him he could continue to use it ***in the event he puts it back unharmed.*** He doesn't put it back, but instead puts it in a precarious spot where it can fall. I tell him to move it, but he refuses. Later on, he ends up dropping and breaking the controller (he technically broke the mechanism that connects the right trigger to the circuit, which renders RT unusable. Therefore, the whole thing is useless because RT is so universaly used). I inform him of this, and tell him he can get me a new controller or reimburse me for my purchase. While normally I wouldn't care, this particular controller was the only one that worked with the computer, so I cannot play games that require a controller now (emulators). ---- Fast forward to now: my brother announces that he is planning to buy a new hunting game (with what funds, I don't know, since he doesn't have a job and has been known to take money). I tell him that he must get me a new controller before proceeding with the purchase. He at first dodges it, claiming the controller isn't mine, then that he didn't brake it (even though I have a witness), followed by his flat-out refusal to purchase it. Now I am planning to take his new game and withhold it from him until he reimburses me for the controller he broke. I have given him multiple warnings, and he had ignored all of them. Does that make me an asshole? P.S. I have more than enough money to purchase a new controller. This is more about his refusal to repay me and his ignorance than it is my care for a new controller. **TL;DR** - My brother owes me money for something of mine he broke. He is planning to buy something, and I plan to take it from him until he brings me my money or a replacement."

The job isn't particularly bad, its just not something I really want to go to every weekend between 10 PM and 6 AM, and not something I want to fuck up my sleep schedule to do either. I'm already feeling the effects of this, as I slept between the hours of 7 AM and 11 AM this morning (or... yesterday), but now at 1 AM, I can't fall asleep. I also just don't really like the job. Its overnights at a 24/hr convenience store, not particularly exciting. I like the people who work there, and they seem to like me, but its a lot of the shit work that I'm not keen on doing. I'm still actively looking for jobs. I've only worked three days and I've already decided I kind of hate it. Am I the Asshole because as soon as I find a new, different, better job, I plan on putting in a two weeks and getting the fuck out of there?"
93,"AITA for not turning and cutting off oncoming traffic? This morning, I was stopped at the ""T"" [right here] waiting for the traffic to clear up so I could turn right on Ohio. There were a LOT of cars, as there always are in the morning, heading towards Sepulveda, so you kind of have to wait a long time for someone to actually slow down and let you in. Or you have to wait for the light at Sepulveda to turn red and for traffic to pile up at it and work its way back to you before someone ""keeps clear"" and provides a gap you can go into once the light turns green and people start to take off again. Anyway, this older dude behind me in a sedan starts honking and flipping me off, telling me to ""go! go! go!""... I motioned to him that there was still oncoming traffic, and that I would be cutting them off if I went, but he continued to honk and flip me off. I told him to calm down, at which point he flew off the handle and started flipping me off even harder and yelling at the top of his lungs. I just patiently waited for a sufficient gap to appear. When I did enter Ohio, he followed close behind, still honking and flipping me off. I was going to turn left on Sepulveda, so when I got into the turning lane, he pulls up beside me on my right and goes, ""FUCK YOU!! SUCK MY DICK! MOTHERFUCKER!!"" whilst flipping me off. He then proceeded to turn right, going south on Sepulveda. I figured he probably could have saved himself some headaches if he had just turned on Massachusetts instead. But am I the asshole for not endangering myself and those around me?"
94,"AITA for calling out suitemates racism, but apparently not understanding their lives? Not sure if this is important, but I'm a female living in a gender neutral suite with two guys (Frank and Liam). They are my best friends at school, but we are currently not talking because we had an argument that eventually led to Frank's girlfriend (Tina) storming out over being called racist. I will paraphrase the conversation. Frank: Seriously guys, I know that I joke about being racist, but I'm really not. But, in my personal experience, every single black girl I've ever met has been really fucking rude and annoying. Me: ...No, that's definitely racist. Frank: It's really not because it's true [insert story here] Me: Just because that happened doesn't mean you can stereotype an entire group of people Frank wtf. Tina: Throwawayparro, I've slept with this man for two years, he's no racist. I wouldn't sleep with a racist! Me: But literally what he just said was fucking racist, and honestly, you're racist! I've heard you say racist shit! Tina: No I just talk about stuff that's happened to me. They're racist against me. They're all fucking like that. Blah blah, they get money for school and I don't just because of their skin color. Frank: Okay, FINE throwawayparro, I'm RACIST because of my PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. [Insert hour long argument about white privilege etc] Liam: Okay throwawayparro, my sister was once threatened by a black guy that he'd rape her and now she's scared of black guys. Can you really say that's racist? Me: I'm sorry that happened to her, but YES! That's racist! Tina: There's no way that's racist, I can totally understand why she'd feel that way! Eventually during this conversation, Tina admits that she really hates black people. [Insert me trying to explain what racism is and that even if you feel justified for hating a group of people, you're still racist] Tina: Okay you know what you have no idea what I've been through and how hard my job has been because of all the awful shit black people say to me at my job, and you obviously DON'T CARE. [Tina proceeds to storm off] So basically the argument ended after that, there's a lot of other shit that happened but those are the barebone details. I guess it's important to mention that Tina honestly has had a really shitty life and it's hard for her to understand privilege because she's extremely poor, and I feel for her, but some of the things she said were still completely unacceptable to me. Now none of those three people will talk to me except Frank occasionally, it's been two days. AITA?"
95,AITA for having this argument with a feminist?
96,"AITA for getting mad at someone for stating his opinion on someone else's sexuality? [Context 1] [Context 2] [My posts] I got a bit upset here, and I wanted to know if anyone thinks I was justifiably upset, or if I was overreacting."
97,"AITAH for Chewing out an Amazon Marketplace Business? So I order a computer case fulfilled through an amazon seller at about 1pm on a thursday. Base shipping was around $11, ""Expedited"" is $20. I want it by the weekend so I grab the ""Expedited"" option. On saturday, I decide to track the package and there still isn't tracking info up. I send them a friendly email to the extent of ""hey, could you update the tracking info?"" They do, and it turns out that it was shipped FedEx ground. When I send them an email asking ""What gives, I paid for expedited,"" they didn't sent me anything back. Finally, about a week after I get the package (7 days after they ship it), I post a review that reflects my displeasure. Yesterday, they get back to me that if I remove the review, they will refund the excess money I paid for expedited shipping. I say I will as long as they tell me what the alternate method for non-expedited shipping is. They just got back to me and told me that it's ground. They literally charged me $10 for nothing, their reasoning is that ""it would have taken two weeks otherwise,"" meaning it would have taken them seven days to actually put it in the mail. Now, $10 isn't a lot of money, that's why i spent it on something as trivial as getting a package a few days earlier, but from where I'm sitting, it looks like they are scamming people double for shipping and pocketing pure profit and that just doesn't sit right with me. I want to send them a ""fuck you, this isn't how ethical business is done"" email and open a ticket with amazon, but I wanted to run it by a third party first in case I actually am the asshole."
98,"AITA for hating my dad and uncle? I'm using a throw away. So, I am still in High School, but growing up my life hasn't been very fun. My parents divorced early and I lived with my mom from 6-13 in Ohio, whereas I had been in Texas before. Anyway, When I was 13, I came home from school one day and my mom had been arrested for like the 5th time for doing drugs. But this time was permanent. (I haven't seen her since.) After that, my grandma drove up to Ohio from Texas to get me, and brought my dad with her. Then we drove back, and I moved in with my grandma. My grandma is awesome. Anyway, I found out shortly after moving in that my uncle would also be living with my grandma. My uncle is 40. He has ""mental problems"" as my grandparents describe it, so they use that as an excuse to put up with his bs, such as leaving messes everywhere, trashes my grandmas car, never having a job, and they said he will probably never move out because is isn't capable. So that went on for about 2 years, and oh man I hated it. His blatant disrespect for how lucky he was made me so angry. He was practically sucking financial resources out of my grandparents for free because he was lazy. Two years of rent free life. That combined with the fact that he is an enormous jerk really makes me hate him. After those 2 years, my grandma brings up that my dad, back in Dallas (I live in a very small town about an hour away) has been living on the streets long enough, so she lets HIM move in as well. When HE moves in, he does the same thing as my uncle. Freeloading, whining, being ungrateful, and just generally being a drain and a pain in the ass. Having to live with these two constantly makes me dread being home. It has made me really sour. I literally never smile when they are around, and I never speak to them. When they speak to me I just answer with quick one word answers and try to end the conversation as quickly as possible. My uncle still lives here, going on nearly 4 years (I'm 16.). My dad has been here for about 3 months, but he is no closer to moving out than he was when he got here. I am constantly reassured he will be gone as soon as he gets his first paycheck, but he doesn't have a job and I'm not holding my breathe. My grandma knows I am super unhappy with them being here, but she and my sister both say I am being a dick. They say that my dad and uncle are family, and I shouldn't hate them, that I should give them more chances. Since my entire life all of my family, besides my little sister and grandparents, have been drug addicts, failures, and freeloaders, I never really learned to value"
99,"I wasn't satisfied with having to take a class over the summer so I went around my adviser and asked the professor how he felt. AITA? **TLDR: I didn't pass a class I needed to continue in my program. I wanted to make it up during the fall semester instead of over the summer. My adviser said I couldn't so I went straight to the professor and was told I was disrespectful for going over her head. AITA?** For my major I needed a B- minimum in a lower level history class. I got a C+. I was told I had to take another lower level history class over the summer on campus to continue in the program. Most students live within an hour of campus. I live out of state and couldn't afford to stay on campus. I talked to my adviser and got approved to take a similar, very expensive, class online through another university. Older students in my position mentioned that they didn't have to make up the lower level class over the summer and they took an additional upper level history class during the school year. My adviser said that was not an option. I was not satisfied. I went to the very old and influential history professor for our department and asked him what he'd be most comfortable with. He sided with me because of a number of factors including: * my distance from home * students doing the same thing in the past * my good GPA * not trusting an outside institution * overlapping content with my minor. He claimed to be the one I really needed permission from. When I told my adviser I was informed I was being disrespectful for trying to work around the system and going over her head after getting a no. I ended up taking the online class. The way I see it I was trying to be assertive, explore all my options, advocate for myself, and avoid financial costs. The way she sees it I'm an entitled brat who thinks the rules don't apply to me, they were generous enough by letting me stay home, and I should have just made the grade to begin with. What do you think? Was I the asshole? In the end, if I had any shot of saving myself and my family a few thousand dollars of tuition, it was probably worth offending someone but I'm still torn up over it."
100,"AITA for smiling at someone on the subway? My boyfriend and I visited Toronto recently to go to the Museum. Parking is expensive, so we parked at the edge of the city and took the subway. We had a great day, and I was in a really good mood. The subway was packed on our way back, but I didn't let it dampen my mood. I stood holding the bar and I guess I had made eye contact with various people (mistake #1, I suppose). This young woman sitting with a magazine says ""why are you smiling at me?"" Me, leaning forward: I'm sorry? Her: You shouldn't smile at people. It's insulting. Me: Oh...sorry. The whole thing had me really perplexed, which turned into annoyance. Part of me wishes I'd reacted a little faster (""if you think that's insulting, wait until you hear this one, lady...""). Part of me also wondered if it was cultural, but she didn't have an accent at all (whatever that's worth). So, am I the asshole here? I completely understand if you call me a weirdo, but smiling at her wasn't really intentional. Like I said, I was in a good mood."
